##3.2 Grammar and Punctuations

###Serial Comma

Use a comma before the “and” in a series: e.g. oranges, bananas, and pears.

###Abbreviations

Write abbreviations without periods: e.g. USA, LA, DCA.

###Possessives

When creating a possessive with a word or name that ends in an “s” or “z”, use an end apostrophe, i.e. Lucky Dragons’ project The Spreading Ground.

###Paragraphs

The more contemporary practice is to double space between each paragraph rather than indenting the first line of each paragraph.

We use the long spelling of “catalogue” and “dialogue.”

We use the older spelling of “theatre” in the names of DCA’s theaters.

Image credits are written in the following format: Artist, Title, Year, Size, Material(s), Courtesy of..., Photographer.

All titles (shows or works) are italicized. If they cannot be italicized, put them in quotes, i.e. "Winning the Freedom to Marry.”
