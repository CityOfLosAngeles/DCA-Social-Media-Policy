## Social Media Policy and Guidelines

This is a versioned repository of social media policy and guidelines for the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs (DCA). It was developed to ensure the proper usage of DCA’s identity and social media platforms and established for the sole purpose of maintaining unity and public presentation awareness. When these guidelines are adhered to and used consistently, the developed graphics, elements, and messaging will create a strong aesthetic and brand awareness across platforms.

We took inspirations from The Andy Warhol Museum’s public repository of [digital strategy](https://github.com/thewarholmuseum/digital-strategy/) and adopted the open source practice from software development. Sharing the content, process, and framework of our policy and guidelines formation furthers the public mission of the Department of Cultural Affairs.
