#1. Usage Policy

##1.1 Guidelines

These are the guidelines and recommended practices for DCA-operated social media and personal engagement with social media. If you have suggestions for how to make these guidelines more helpful and encouraging for further engagement, please contact us at dca.digital@lacity.org.

1. Administrators of DCA-sponsored social media shall include a disclaimer statement on the profile “Users and visitors to this social media site shall be notified that the intended purpose of the site is to serve as a mechanism for communication between DCA and members of the public. We reserve the right to remove any posts or comments that are offensive or inappropriate.”

2. The lines between public and private and personal and professional are blurred. By identifying yourself as DCA’s employee, you are creating perceptions about your expertise and about the City and its related legislative stakeholders, customers, business partners, and the general public. Be sure that all content created is consistent with your work and with DCA’s values and professional standards.

3. Be judicious about how you use your personal accounts on social media. If you identify yourself as a member of DCA staff in any online social media platforms or if your affiliation with DCA could be presumed, you must make it clear that you are not speaking for DCA. Please use this statement when necessary: “The views expressed here are my own and not those of my employer.”

4. Be aware that any social media content, whether public or private, may be subject to public disclosure.

##1.2 Compliance

DCA reserves the right to request that online communications cease if content from an employee, volunteer, and/or intern are in violation of organizational policies, values, or local, state, or federal privacy and intellectual property.
