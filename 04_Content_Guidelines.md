##4.2 Procedure

###Requests

Requests for promotion on official DCA Social Media channels are the responsibility of each program director and/or Cultural Center director. Requests for Social Media promotion must be submitted through the request form. The form must be complete.

###Deadlines

Requests for promotion on official DCA Social Media channels must be submitted at least 5 business days before requested post date(s).

###Approval

Images and copy will be reviewed for approval prior to post scheduling. Note: we ask for images clear of text and/or graphic elements. We ask this to maintain unity and consistency across channels.

###Submission

All requests will be processed in the order they were received. Rush/Immediate requests are discouraged. All rush requests must be approved by DCA’s Director of Marketing and Development.

##4.4 Best Practices

###Create Epic Content

To build trust and affinity with our public we need to be creating compelling content that encourages people to repost and share with their contacts. This also adds value to our audience furthering the mission of the agency. Looking at what other high traffic accounts and government art agencies post on a regular basis we’ve observed examples of what content works: UNESCO, NEA, NEH, Smithsonian Institution, Americans for the Arts, California Arts Council, MOCA, LACMA, and the Hammer.

###Be Consistent

We want to grow our following and encourage engagement. We need to be posting consistently every day. Suggestions are per channel.

###Use Hashtags, when applicable

In general hashtags are best when used for timely events/trends. They also categorize content (#dcagrantee) and build community. Refer to the DCA Hashtag Guidelines for specific uses.

###ABC (Always Be Closing)

Every post/tweet needs to have a purpose, and always have a call to action.

###Track your success, and failures

Reports are sent to the Director of Marketing and Development biweekly. See Report Sample.

###Follow Others

We use the follow me, follow you strategy, but be strategic and discerning: determine if the profile boosts DCA's mission, and why DCA should follow.

###Share for Shares

Do as many S4S as you can. This is critical for growth. Get other accounts to amplify. See Social Media Allies document.

###Have Fun & Experiment!

Social Media is fun and constantly changing. Read blogs (see the Social Media section in the feedly.com) and research trends for new and emerging strategies.

###Be Sure to Track What You Test

Sprout Social is an incredible resource for generating timely and dynamic reports. Use the internal tagging (not to be confused with hashtagging) function to track campaigns and test-runs.
